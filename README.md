## Lessons Learned

How to use UseContext Hook and why it is used?

The main idea of using the Usecontext hook is to allow your components to access global data and re-render when that global data is changed. Context solves the props drilling problem: when you have to pass down props from parents to children. You can hold inside the context: global state.
